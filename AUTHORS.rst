How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives due to generous help by contributors sharing their time; ``uareach`` is no different.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started:

- Fill out and send in our online `Contribution Agreement Form here <http://docs.urbanairship.com/contribution-agreement.html>`_.
- Try to limit each pull request to one change only.
- To run the test suite, you will need to install nose_ and run nosetests.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
  Use present tense, semantic newlines, and add a link to your pull request.
- No contribution is too small; please also submit for typos and grammar mistakes!
- Don’t break backward compatibility.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code. This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won’t be merged.
- Write `good test docstrings`_. This project uses the `Google doc string`_ format.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- If you address review feedback, make sure to bump the pull request. Maintainers don’t receive notifications when you push new commits.
